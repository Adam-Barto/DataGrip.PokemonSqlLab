### Part 2: Simple Selects and Counts
Directions: Write a sql query or sql queries that can answer the following questions

* What are all the types of pokemon that a pokemon can have?
    # SELECT * FROM types;

    # Didn't feel like typing them all out here.
* What is the name of the pokemon with id 45?
    # SELECT name FROM pokemons WHERE id = 45;

    # Eevee
* How many pokemon are there?
    # SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pokemons;

    # 656
* How many types are there?
    # SELECT COUNT(*) FROM types;

    # 18
* How many pokemon have a secondary type?
    # SELECT * FROM pokemons WHERE secondary_type is NULL;

    # 340
### Part 3: Joins and Groups
Directions: Write a sql query or sql queries that can answer the following questions


* What is each pokemon's primary type?
    # SELECT pokemons.name, types.name FROM pokemons
    # LEFT JOIN types ON types.id = pokemons.primary_type;
* What is Rufflet's secondary type?
    # SELECT pokemons.name, types.name FROM pokemons
    # LEFT JOIN types on types.id = pokemons.secondary_type
    # WHERE pokemons.name = 'Rufflet';

    # Flying
* What are the names of the pokemon that belong to the trainer with trainerID 303?
    # SELECT pokemons.name, pt.pokemon_id FROM pokemon_trainer AS pt
    # RIGHT JOIN pokemons ON pokemons.id = pt.pokemon_id
    # WHERE pt.trainerID = 303;

    # | name      | pokemon_id |
    # +-----------+------------+
    # | Wailord   |          2 |
    # | Vileplume |          3 |
    # +-----------+------------+
* How many pokemon have a secondary type `Poison`
    # SELECT COUNT(pokemons.name) AS "Pokemon with second type as poison" FROM pokemons
    # LEFT JOIN types ON types.id = pokemons.secondary_type
    # WHERE types.name = 'Poison';

    # +------------------------------------+
    # | Pokemon with second type as poison |
    # +------------------------------------+
    # |                                 31 |
    # +------------------------------------+

* What are all the primary types and how many pokemon have that type?
* How many pokemon at level 100 does each trainer with at least one level 100 pokemone have? (Hint: your query should not display a trainer
* How many pokemon only belong to one trainer and no other?

### Part 4: Final Report

Directions: Write a query that returns the following collumns:

| Pokemon Name | Trainer Name | Level | Primary Type | Secondary Type |
|:------------:|:------------:|:-----:|:------------:|:--------------:|
| Pokemon's name| Trainer's name| Current Level| Primary Type Name| Secondary Type Name|

Sort the data by finding out which trainer has the strongest pokemon so that this will act as a ranking of strongest to weakest trainer. You may interpret strongest in whatever way you want, but you will have to explain your decision.

## Turning in this assignment

To turn in this assignment, create files for each part with at least one query for each question answered. Above each query include a comment with the question you were answering. The files should have the extension `.sql`
Example:

```SQL
 # How many characters are in the string 'Hello World!'
 SELECT CHAR_LENGTH('Hello World!') AS length_of_hello_world
```

For Part 4 specifically also leave a comment explaining how your query is deciding who the strongest trainer is

Once all of that is done, submit your file by saving it in the "answers" directory and committing it to your fork.
